Whack A Mole is a simple game in which the user has to whack the mole as many times as possible within 60 seconds. The game was invented in 1976 by Aaron Fetcher of Creative Engineering Inc USA.


RULES
The object of the game is to force the individual moles back into their holes by hitting them directly on the head with the mallet, thereby adding to the player's score. The more quickly this is done the higher the final score will be (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole).
